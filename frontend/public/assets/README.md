## Replacing Placeholders

To enhance the game, replace these placeholder files with:

1. **Images**:
   - Recommended size: 64x64 pixels for sprites
   - Format: PNG with transparency
   - Consider using pixel art or simple vector graphics

2. **Audio**:
   - Format: WAV or MP3
   - Keep files small (< 100KB each)
   - Sound effects should be short (< 1 second)

All files should maintain the same names to work with the existing game code.
